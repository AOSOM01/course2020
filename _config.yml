title: Data Science Workshop
subtitle: Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Big Data
description: |
    Data can be a valuable asset, especially when thereâ€™s a lot of it. Exploratory data analysis, business intelligence, and machine learning can benefit tremendously if such big data can be wrangled and modelled at scale. Apache Spark is an open-source distributed engine for querying, processing and modeling big data. In this one-day workshop, you will learn how to leverage Spark and R/Python to process and model big data with common machine learning algorithm. By the end of this workshop, you will have a solid understanding of how to process big data using Spark and how to build common machine learning models in the cloud environment. You will also learn the motivation and use cases of deep learning through hands-on exercises.
